We are in the middle of developing a website, but there are multiple issues that need immediate attention to ensure a fully functional, visually consistent, and content-complete platform. Below is a list of issues and tasks that need to be fixed and completed:

🔧 1. Homepage Issues
Several homepage sections are either not visible or contain incomplete/missing content.

Ensure every section is properly structured, filled with relevant text, images, and links.

Fix layout or styling issues that cause visibility problems or make content unreadable.

📁 2. Missing Content and Navigation for Key Sections
The following buttons do not work correctly due to missing content or broken routing:

View All Products

View All Courses

View All Events

Fix routing for each of these buttons and link them to fully functional listing pages.

Populate those listing pages with full entries for each product, course, and event.

🎓 3. Courses Section – Training and Demos
Inside the Courses page:

The Training and Demos section is non-functional.

Calendar View and List View are broken or empty.

Implement both views with:

Properly routed data

Upcoming sessions, dates, speakers/trainers

Filters and search functionality (optional but preferred)

📄 4. Missing Dedicated Detail Pages
Ensure that each Product, Service, Course, and Event has a dedicated detail page that includes:

Title, description, and key highlights

Media: Images, icons, or video thumbnails

Pricing (if applicable)

FAQs or detailed breakdowns

Clear call-to-action buttons: Enroll Now, Buy Now, Register, Learn More, etc.

🎨 5. CSS Styling and UI/UX Bugs
The index.css file contains variables or references for blue and purple colors, but these are not rendering across the site.

This is causing:

Invisible or broken content

Buttons that are missing styles or unreadable

Inconsistent text colors and backgrounds

Fix the CSS so blue and purple colors are properly applied throughout all components, including:

Headers, footers, navbars

Buttons, cards, and links

Backgrounds and text overlays

🧪 6. UI/UX Quality Pass
There are multiple visual inconsistencies:

Mismatched font colors on inappropriate backgrounds

Overlapping elements

Broken or non-styled buttons

Conduct a full UI/UX audit and fix:

Color contrast issues

Spacing and alignment problems

Component responsiveness (mobile/tablet/desktop)

Button hover states and transitions

✅ Final Goals
Every section and component must have complete, rich content.

All views and buttons should be fully interactive and properly routed.

CSS styles should be consistent, accessible, and applied site-wide.

The entire website should be visually polished, bug-free, and user-friendly.

Please regenerate and finalize the site accordingly, ensuring it's ready for full deployment.
