Please address the following issues and improvements across the website:

✅ 1. Courses Page:
Fix the “Explore All Courses” and “View All Courses” buttons — currently, they do not link anywhere or return errors.

These buttons should link to a dedicated "All Courses" subpage with proper layout and navigation.

Create a detailed subpage for each course with:

Course title

Description

Learning outcomes or syllabus

Duration

Pricing (if applicable)

Enroll/Register CTA button

Ensure existing courses are listed clearly and uniformly, with consistent formatting, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

✅ 2. Products Page:
Fix the “View Details” button for each product — currently it redirects to a "No product found" or error page.

Each product should have a functioning detail page with:

Product image

Description

Key features/specifications

Price (if shown)

Purchase or Contact CTA

Ensure there are no broken links or missing product data.

✅ 3. Homepage Improvements:
Hero Section:

Replace placeholder/boilerplate content (e.g., “Title”, “Description”) with actual copy that reflects our brand.

Suggested example (customize if needed):

"Empowering Learners & Businesses Through Next-Gen Education & Digital Products."
"We offer industry-aligned training programs and innovative tools to help you stay ahead in your career or business."

Section Below Hero (e.g., About/Intro Section):

Replace placeholder text with content like:

"At [Company Name], we specialize in delivering cutting-edge training and digital products designed to help professionals and businesses succeed in today’s fast-paced world. Whether you’re looking to upskill, reskill, or adopt technology that transforms your operations, we’ve got you covered."

✅ 4. Accessibility & Design Improvements:
Ensure all buttons, links, and text elements have proper contrast against the background — especially those on white backgrounds. Use accessible color combinations.

Perform a full UI/UX pass to ensure design consistency across all pages.

✅ 5. General Site Optimization:
Test and improve:

Mobile responsiveness

Page loading speed

SEO meta tags and descriptions

Internal linking structure

Alt text for all images
