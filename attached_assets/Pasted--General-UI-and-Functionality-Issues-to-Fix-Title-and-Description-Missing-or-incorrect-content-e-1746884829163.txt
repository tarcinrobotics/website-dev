Home Page ‚Äì Service Offering Filter

Service filtering not working correctly; validate the logic and fix any broken filtering.

Products Page ‚Äì Education and Platform Switch

Tabs/switches between "Education" and "Platform" are not working ‚Äî clicking one should show its relevant content.

üîç Specific Component-Level Fixes
Navbar
Pages Home, Product, Service, and Education are not displaying ‚Äî ensure routes and component imports are correct.

Hero Section
Hero content is missing on the following pages:

Home

Product

Education

Contact

Ensure the Hero section component is rendered and receiving proper props/content.
Example Hero code (already present):

jsx
Copy
Edit
<section className="pt-32 pb-16 md:pt-40 md:pb-24 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 text-white relative overflow-hidden">
Home Page
CTASection: Buttons and content are missing ‚Äî ensure both are rendered and styled properly.

Product Page
Flagship Product Section: Filter interaction is broken ‚Äî clicking a category hides the content.

Reference code (for filtering):

tsx
Copy
Edit
{["All Products", "Robotics", "IoT Devices", "Software", "Educational"].map((category) => (
  <Button
    key={category}
    onClick={() => setActiveCategory(category as Category)}
    ...
  >
    {category}
  </Button>
))}
Ensure the state update correctly renders the associated product content.

Product > Code Asthram
Clicking does not switch the page ‚Äî verify navigation handler or routing logic.

About Page > Our Journey (Timeline)
Timeline is present but not animating or rendering correctly. Ensure:

timelineEvents is properly populated.

motion.div is receiving expected props and animations trigger based on visibility.

Example code for reference:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="absolute left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 h-full w-1 bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700"></div>

{timelineEvents.map((event, index) => (
  <motion.div
    key={index}
    ...
  >
    {/* Timeline item */}
  </motion.div>
))}
Please update the codebase to reflect these fixes and ensure all sections render correctly with full content and working interactivity.
