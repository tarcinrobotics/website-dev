⚠️ Prompt: Fix Admin "Settings" Page, Fill Homepage Content, Rework All Broken Buttons
The CMS is now functioning for blog, events, and careers — thank you. However, the following issues are still unresolved or newly discovered. Please address them completely and verify all fixes work in the browser:

1. 🛠️ Admin Panel – “Settings” Page Broken
When I click on the “Settings” option in the admin sidebar, it shows:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Page Not Found
✅ Fix Required:

Implement the /admin/dashboard/settings route if it's meant to exist

If it was mistakenly left in the menu, either:

Remove it, or

Implement a real settings page that includes configurable options like:

Site title

Admin profile

Optional homepage content overrides (if you want to be advanced)

2. 🧱 Homepage – Hero and Narrative Sections Still Empty
The hero section and the content sections below (like mission, value, community intro, etc.) are still empty or using placeholder text.

✅ Fix Required:

Add proper content to the hero section:

Headline (e.g., “Empowering the S2P Community”)

Subtext/Tagline (e.g., “Join our mission to connect and grow together”)

CTA Button (e.g., “Explore More” or “Join the Movement”)

Fill below-the-hero sections with relevant narrative content such as:

Mission statement

Services overview

Key community highlights

Ensure the scroll-down button in the hero section now smoothly scrolls to the next filled section

3. 🧪 UI Audit – Broken / Cut-off Buttons Across Site
Several buttons on both the admin dashboard and public pages:

Are cut off, misaligned, or clipped on different screen sizes

Don’t respond to clicks or have no visible feedback/action

✅ Fix Required:

Perform a site-wide audit of all <button> elements

Fix visual and layout issues (e.g., padding, overflow, alignment)

Ensure every button:

Is responsive and accessible

Has visible hover/focus styles

Performs a valid action or links correctly

Test all major buttons across:

Admin (Create, Save, Edit, Delete)

Homepage (Hero CTA, Learn More, etc.)

Navigation (internal routing buttons/links)

✅ Once completed, I expect:

Admin “Settings” either works or is removed

Homepage hero and narrative sections are meaningfully filled

Scroll button in hero works properly

All buttons are fully styled, clickable, and mobile-compatible
